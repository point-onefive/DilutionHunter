    "hook": "🚨 $AMZE dilution radar lighting up\n\n+91% spike off lows → still +47%\nATM filed 2025-11-13\n$3M cap with < 1 month cash runway\n\nPrice up, balance sheet stressed, ATM ready\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM?\n\nCompany files to sell new shares at market prices through a broker. They usually wait for spikes, then dump shares into strength to raise cash. More shares → more supply → pressure on price.",
      "2/ $AMZE setup:\n\n• Market cap: ~$3M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Move: +91% peak → now +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n• Debt: $8.1M\n\nHigh price + almost no cash + fresh ATM = classic dilution setup.",
      "3/ What to watch on $AMZE:\n\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Selling pressure growing each day\n• Support breaks that do not bounce\n• Already ~45% off the highs\n\nMotive is clear: critical distress, ATM is survival, not optional.",
      "4/ Scenarios on $AMZE:\n\nBear builds if:\n• Large red day with volume spike\n• Price cannot reclaim recent highs\n• ATM usage starts showing up\n\nBull invalidation: strong volume breakout that holds.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not the run.",
      "5/ Takeaway on $AMZE:\n\nMicro-cap, ~$3M cap, $300K cash, $2.0M/month burn, < 1 month runway, recent ATM, and a big recent spike.\n\nElevated risk profile. Pattern fits raise-into-strength playbook.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
