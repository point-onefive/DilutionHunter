    "breakdown": [
      "ATM = At-The-Market offering. Company can sell new shares anytime → more supply → weaker price. Like splitting a pizza into more slices — same pie, smaller pieces. 🍕",
      "Why this caught my eye:\n• Market cap: $2.3M (tiny = vulnerable)\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-21 (6 days ago)\n• Price spiked +56% → now +22%\nHigh price + likely cash need = prime dilution setup",
      "Additional context:\n• Volume fading — early signs of distribution\n• Small float → dilution hits harder per share\n• 34% off highs — first cracks visible\nLikely motive: company may need funding soon.",
      "Bear thesis builds if:\n• Heavy red candle with elevated sell volume\n• Price fails to reclaim highs\n• ATM usage confirmed\n\nBull case: strong volume breakout → ATM may pause.\nTraders get trapped when dilution lands during pullbacks — not the run.",
      "This isn't advice — just pattern recognition.\n\nBig spike + small cap + fresh ATM = elevated risk profile.\n\nWatch how it reacts to selling pressure — that's where dilution becomes visible. 🦅"
