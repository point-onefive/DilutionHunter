    "hook": "🚨 $AMZE dilution risk on watch\n\n+91% spike → still +47%\nATM filed 2025-11-13\n$3M cap · < 1 month cash runway\n\nMicro-cap with survival ATM and recent pump — elevated dilution setup\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM?\n\nCompany files to sell new shares at market prices through a broker. They usually hit the sell button into strength so they can raise more cash. More shares sold → more supply → price often gets pressured.\n\n$AMZE filed one.",
      "2/ The $AMZE setup:\n\n• Market cap: ~$3M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Price: +91% peak → now +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n\nHigh price + urgent cash need + fresh ATM = classic dilution setup risk.",
      "3/ Confirming signals to track on $AMZE:\n\n• Heavy red candle on big volume\n• Selling pressure growing each day\n• Support breaks without clean bounce\n• Already ~45% off recent highs\n\nMotive is clear: critical distress, balance sheet needs cash fast.",
      "4/ $AMZE scenarios:\n\nBear case builds if:\n• Big red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot retest or beat recent highs\n• ATM usage shows in filings or tape\n\nBull case: strong breakout on real volume that holds.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not the run.",
      "5/ Final takeaway on $AMZE:\n\nMicro-cap, survival-level cash, ATM ready, and a recent spike already fading. Company needs to sell shares to stay alive, which can pressure price as supply increases.\n\nElevated risk profile.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
