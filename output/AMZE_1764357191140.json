    "hook": "🚨 Dilution pattern on $AMZE. Ran +91%, still up +47%, but a fresh 424B5 ATM hit on 2025-11-13. $2.8M micro-cap, almost no cash, heavy burn, sub-1 month runway. Company needs to sell shares into strength. Full breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM? Company files to sell new shares at market through a broker. They usually hit the bid during spikes because higher prices = more cash per share. More shares sold → more supply → pressure on the stock.",
      "2/ The setup on $AMZE:\n• Mkt cap: ~$2.8M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Move: +91% peak, now +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: ~$2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n• Already raised $4.6M last quarter via stock\nHigh price + urgent cash need = prime dilution setup.",
      "3/ Confirming signals to watch on $AMZE:\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Selling pressure building each day\n• Key support breaks and does not bounce\n• Already ~45% off highs\nCompany is in critical distress. Motive to use the ATM is obvious.",
      "4/ Scenarios:\nBear case builds if:\n• Large red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot reclaim recent highs\n• ATM usage starts showing in filings/volume\n\nBull invalidation: strong breakout on real volume that holds.\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not the initial run.",
      "5/ Takeaway on $AMZE:\nMicro-cap, tiny float, ATM loaded, and less than a month of cash with $8.1M debt and an accelerating burn. Management has every reason to sell shares into strength.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
