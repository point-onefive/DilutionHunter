    "hook": "🚨 Dilution watch on $AMZE. Ripped +91%, still up +47% while a fresh ATM from 2025-11-13 hangs over a tiny ~$2.8M cap. Cash nearly gone, survival depends on selling shares into strength. Elevated risk setup. Full breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM? Company files to sell new shares at market through a broker. They usually sell into price spikes so they can raise more cash. More shares sold → more supply → pressure on the stock.",
      "2/ $AMZE setup:\n• Micro-cap ≈ $2.8–3M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Ran +91%, now holding +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\nThey need cash fast. High price + critical cash need = classic dilution setup.",
      "3/ What to watch on $AMZE:\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Persistent selling on every bounce\n• Key support breaks and does not snap back\n• Already ~45% off the highs\nMotive is clear: balance sheet in critical distress, ATM ready.",
      "4/ Scenarios:\nBear builds if:\n• Red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot reclaim prior highs\n• ATM usage shows up in filings or tape\n\nBull invalidation: strong, sustained breakout on real volume.\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during the pullback, not the run.",
      "5/ Takeaway on $AMZE:\nMicro-cap, almost no cash, heavy burn, fresh ATM, and a recent spike already fading. Company has every reason to sell shares into strength to survive. Elevated risk profile.\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
