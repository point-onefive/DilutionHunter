    "breakdown": [
      "ATM = At-The-Market offering. Company can sell new shares anytime → more supply → weaker price. Like splitting a pizza into more slices — same pie, smaller pieces. 🍕",
      "Why this caught my eye: • Market cap: $97M (tiny = vulnerable) • ATM filed: 2025-10-28 (30 days ago) • Price spiked +75% → now +65% High price + likely cash need = prime dilution setup",
      "Additional context: • Volume fading — early signs of distribution • Small float → dilution hits harder per share • 10% off highs — first cracks visible Likely motive: company may need funding soon.",
      "Bear thesis builds if: • Heavy red candle with elevated sell volume • Price fails to reclaim highs • ATM usage confirmed Bull case: strong volume breakout → ATM may pause. Traders get trapped when dilution lands during pullbacks — not the run.",
      "This isn't advice — just pattern recognition. Big spike + small cap + fresh ATM = elevated risk profile. Watch how it reacts to selling pressure — that's where dilution becomes visible. 🦅"
