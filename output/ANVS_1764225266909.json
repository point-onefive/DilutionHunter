    "breakdown": [
      "ATM = At-The-Market stock issuance. Company can sell new shares anytime → more supply → weaker price. If you're holding an ice-cream cone and more cones appear, yours melts faster. 🍦",
      "Why this caught my eye:\n• Market cap: $97M (tiny, very vulnerable)\n• ATM filing: 14 days ago\n• Price spiked +75% (now at +65%)\nHigh price + low cash = perfect conditions to raise money",
      "Additional context:\n• Volume pattern: fading, indicating distribution\n• Small float: dilution impacts more\n• Trend: pulled back -10% from peak\nThis is how step-one cracks look before big flushes.",
      "Bear thesis builds if:\n• First heavy red candle with elevated sell volume\n• Price fails to reclaim highs\n• ATM usage confirmed\nBull scenario if price runs again on strong volume — ATM may not trigger yet",
      "This isn't advice — just pattern recognition.\nBig spike + small cap + fresh ATM = risk\nTrack price action like a hawk. 🦅"
