    "breakdown": [
      "Here's the mechanism: Annovis Bio ($ANVS) filed an ATM (424B5) to sell new shares at market prices. When the stock price spiked, the company likely started selling into buying pressure, increasing share supply.",
      "The numbers: Filed on 11/13. Stock peaked at +75.2% on day 7, currently +65.1%. The -10.1% pullback signals potential dilution. This isn't just volatility; it's dilution in action.",
      "The lesson: If a stock surges post-ATM filing, it might be the company dumping new shares. Scrutinize the timing of these runs. Companies often cash in when prices soar, leaving late buyers holding the bag."
