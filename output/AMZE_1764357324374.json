    "hook": "🚨 $AMZE dilution risk on the table\n\n+91% spike off lows → still +47%\nATM filed 2025-11-13\n$3M cap · < 1 month cash runway\n\nTiny float, survival ATM, price already fading\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM?\n\nCompany files to sell new shares at market prices through a broker. They usually hit the sell button into strength so they can raise more cash. More shares sold → more supply → price pressure.",
      "2/ $AMZE setup:\n\n• Market cap: ~$3M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Ran +91% off lows → now +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n• Already raised $4.6M last quarter via stock\n\nHigh price + urgent cash need = classic dilution setup.",
      "3/ Confirming signals to watch on $AMZE:\n\n• Big red candle with volume surge\n• Selling pressure building on every bounce\n• Prior support levels breaking and not reclaiming\n• Already 45% off the recent high\n\nMotive is clear: critical financial distress, ATM is survival.",
      "4/ Scenarios:\n\nBear case builds if:\n• Red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot retest or break recent highs\n• ATM usage shows up in filings or tape\n\nBull invalidation: strong, sustained breakout on real volume.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not at the top of the run.",
      "5/ Takeaway on $AMZE:\n\nMicro-cap, ~$3M cap, almost no cash, heavy burn, and a fresh ATM while price is still elevated. That is an elevated risk profile for dilution hitting the tape.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
