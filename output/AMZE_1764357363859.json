    "hook": "🚨 $AMZE dilution radar lighting up\n\n+91% spike highs → now holding +47%\nATM filed 2025-11-13\n$3M cap with < 1 month cash runway\n\nPrice up, balance sheet broken — prime ATM risk\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM?\n\nCompany files to sell new shares at market through a broker. They usually wait for spikes, then dump shares into strength. More shares → more supply → pressure on price.\n\n$AMZE just filed one.",
      "2/ The $AMZE setup:\n\n• Market cap: ~$3M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Ran +91% off lows → still +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n• Already raised $4.6M last quarter via stock\n\nHigh price + urgent cash need = classic dilution setup.",
      "3/ Confirming signals to watch on $AMZE:\n\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Selling pressure growing each bounce\n• Key support breaks and does not recover\n• Already ~45% off recent highs\n\nMotive is clear: critical financial distress and an active ATM.",
      "4/ Scenarios from here:\n\nBear builds if:\n• Red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot reclaim recent highs\n• ATM usage shows up in filings or tape\n\nBull invalidation: strong, sustained breakout on real volume.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not during the first run.",
      "5/ Final takeaway on $AMZE:\n\nMicro-cap (~$3M) with $300K cash, $2.0M/month burn, < 1 month runway, fresh ATM, and a recent +91% spike now fading.\n\nElevated risk profile. This is about reading supply, filings, and motive.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
