    "breakdown": [
      "Here's what happened: $MNDR filed an ATM shelf (424B5) letting them sell new shares anytime. Stock ran +215% on hype. Company saw the spike and started dumping shares into YOUR buy orders.",
      "The math: Filed 11/13. Peaked +215% by day 4. Now? Only +54%. That -161% drop? That's dilution in action. Company got cash, latecomers got bags.",
      "The lesson: When you see a small cap spike right after an ATM filing, ask yourself - who's selling into this rally? Often it's the company itself. The pattern repeats.",
      "The play: Watch for ATM filings. If a stock spikes hard, consider that dilution might be loading up to crash the party. Trade with caution."
