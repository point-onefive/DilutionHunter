    "breakdown": [
      "ATM = At-The-Market offering. Company can sell new shares anytime → more supply → weaker price. Like splitting a pizza into more slices — same pie, smaller pieces. 🍕",
      "Why this caught my eye:\n• Market cap: $21M (tiny = vulnerable)\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13 (14 days ago)\n• Spiked +86% → now -7%\nHigh price + cash need = prime dilution setup",
      "What to watch for:\n• Heavy red candle with volume\n• Selling pressure expanding\n• Support break without recovery\n• 94% off highs — cracks forming\nMotive: company likely needs funding",
      "Bear thesis builds if:\n• Red candle + sell volume spike\n• Price fails to reclaim highs\n• ATM usage confirmed\n\nBull invalidation: strong volume breakout\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution lands during pullbacks — not the run.",
      "Not advice — just pattern recognition. Big spike + small cap + fresh ATM = elevated risk profile. Watch how it reacts to selling pressure. 🦅"
