    "hook": "🚨 Dilution watch on $AMZE. Ripped +91%, still up +47%, but a fresh ATM hit on 2025-11-13. ~$2.8M micro-cap, almost no cash, survival depends on selling shares into strength. Elevated risk profile here. Full breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What's an ATM? Company files to sell new shares at market through a broker. They usually hit the bid during spikes so they can raise more cash. More shares sold → more supply → price often bleeds while they fund operations.",
      "2/ The $AMZE setup:\n• Micro-cap: ~$2.8M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Move: +91% peak → now +47%\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: $2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\nThey already raised $4.6M last quarter via stock. High price + urgent cash need = dilution setup.",
      "3/ Confirming signals to watch on $AMZE:\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Persistent selling into strength\n• Support breaks that do not bounce\n• Already ~45% off the highs\nMotive is clear: critical distress, ATM is a survival tool, not optional.",
      "4/ Scenarios:\nBear builds if:\n• Red candle + volume spike\n• Price cannot reclaim recent highs\n• ATM usage shows up in filings or tape\n\nBull invalidation:\n• Strong breakout on real volume, absorbs selling.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during the pullback, not the run.",
      "5/ Final takeaway on $AMZE:\nTiny cap, critical cash crunch, fresh ATM, and a recent spike. Company has every reason to sell shares into any strength to stay alive. That creates elevated dilution risk. Not advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
