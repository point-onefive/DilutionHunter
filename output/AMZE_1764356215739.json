    "hook": "🚨 Dilution Risk Setup — $AMZE\n\n+91% spike → now +45%\nATM filed 2025-11-13 (recent)\n$2.8M cap = vulnerable\nVolume fading from peak\n\nPump → ATM → slow bleed pattern forming\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "What's an ATM? Company files to sell new shares at market through a broker. Company sells shares → share count rises → more supply. They usually sell into strong spikes to raise the most cash. That selling pressure often caps or reverses the move.",
      "Why this caught my eye:\n• Market cap: $2.8M (tiny = vulnerable)\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13 (14 days ago)\n• Spiked +91% → now +45%\nHigh price + likely cash need + fresh ATM = prime dilution setup if they start selling into strength.",
      "What to watch for:\n• Heavy red candle with volume\n• Selling pressure expanding\n• Support break without recovery\n• 46% off highs — cracks forming\nMotive: company likely needs funding, ATM gives them a direct way to dump shares into any bounce.",
      "Bear thesis builds if:\n• Red candle + sell volume spike\n• Price fails to reclaim recent highs\n• ATM usage confirmed in filings\n\nBull invalidation: strong volume breakout that holds.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during pullbacks, not during the first run.",
      "Not advice — just pattern recognition. Big spike + micro-cap + fresh ATM = elevated risk profile. Company selling shares into the market can shift momentum fast. Watch how $AMZE reacts when real selling pressure shows up. 🦅"
