    "hook": "🚨 $AMZE dilution watch\n\n+91% spike off lows, still +47% from start, ATM filed 2025-11-13, market cap ~$2.8M, cash only $300K with <1 month runway.\n\nThis looks like a tiny company in critical distress that just armed an ATM into a fading spike, so I’m watching for selling pressure to flip into full dilution.\n\nFull breakdown below ↓",
    "breakdown": [
      "1/ What’s an ATM?\nCompany files paperwork to let them sell new shares at market price through a broker.\nThey usually sell into strength because higher prices = more cash per share.\nMore shares sold → more supply → price often weakens.",
      "2/ The $AMZE setup:\n• Market cap: ~$2.8M\n• ATM filed: 2025-11-13\n• Ran +91% off lows, still +47% from start\n• Cash: $300K\n• Burn: ~$2.0M/month\n• Runway: < 1 month\n\nHigh price + almost no cash + fresh ATM = classic dilution setup risk.",
      "3/ What I’m watching on $AMZE:\n• Heavy red candle with big volume\n• Selling pressure growing each day\n• Support breaks that do not bounce\n• Already ~45% off the highs\n\nMotive is clear: critical distress, $8.1M debt, and they already raised ~$4.6M last quarter by issuing stock.",
      "4/ Scenarios on $AMZE:\nBear case builds if:\n• Large red day with volume spike\n• Price cannot get back near the recent highs\n• Signs the ATM is being used into weakness\n\nBull invalidation: strong volume breakout that holds, showing real demand.\n\nTraders get trapped when dilution hits during the pullback, not the initial run.",
      "5/ Final read on $AMZE:\nFresh ATM, sub-$3M market cap, <1 month of cash, accelerating burn, and a run that already faded 45% off the top — I’m tracking for confirmation that selling is ATM-driven, not random.\n\nThis is a watch setup, not an action setup.\n\nNot advice — pattern recognition only. 🦅"
