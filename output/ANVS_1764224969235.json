    "breakdown": [
      "ATM = At-The-Market offering. Translation: the company can print NEW shares and sell them directly into the market. More shares = your slice of the pie gets smaller. Imagine having to share your pizza with more people. 🍕",
      "Why this matters: $97M market cap is tiny, making $ANVS vulnerable. A +75% price spike is like waving cash in front of a cash-strapped company. With an ATM filing just 14 days ago, it's primed for dilution.",
      "Numbers game: Peaked at +75%, now at +65%. That's a 10% drop from the peak. This drop likely happened because new shares are being sold, watering down your investment like adding water to coffee. ☕",
      "Lesson: Watch for ATMs after big spikes in small caps. Spot the signs: small market cap, recent filing, price jump. Stay alert and don't get caught holding the bag when the price crashes."
